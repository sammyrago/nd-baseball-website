        <li class="even"><h3>Coach Augustine</h3>
            <p>I have been passionate about baseball since I was three years old. Growing up, I played little league in Stratford. I also played for a local AAU team called the Stratford Spartans until I was 18. My journey with the sport has been a significant part of my life, shaping my skills and love for the game.

            Currently, I work here at Notre Dame as a math and psychology teacher. This role has allowed me to connect with students inside the classroom, and I am thrilled to extend that connection to the baseball field. Coaching gives me the unique opportunity to mentor students in a different environment, fostering their growth both academically and athletically.
            
            This year, I am especially excited to commit more time and energy to the team, as I have recently completed my graduate studies at Fairfield University. I look forward to an exciting season ahead and to supporting our players in achieving their best both on and off the field!</p></li>
        <li class="odd"><h3>Coach Jon McNelis</h3>
        <p>Coach Jon McNelis joined the Notre Dame baseball coaching staff in the spring of 2024, bringing a wealth of knowledge and enthusiasm to the team. His passion for the game is matched by his impressive track record as both a player and a scholar. Jon's baseball journey began at Amity High School, where he was recognized as an All-SCC player in his senior year. He then took his talents to UConn, where he played Club Baseball and earned First Team All-Conference honors twice, contributing to two conference championships and two regional appearances.
            In addition to his playing experience, Jon has a strong background in nutrition and exercise science, which enhances his coaching approach and understanding of player development. His deep commitment to the sport, combined with his expertise in optimizing athletic performance, makes him a valuable asset to the Notre Dame baseball program.</p>

    <h2>COACHING PHILOSOPHY</h2>
    <p> Consistent with Notre Dame's mission, the Lancers baseball program strives to build character in our student-athletes using baseball as our vehicle. Some of the qualities our young men will always possess are integrity, work ethic, respect, selflessness, and gratitude. We will accomplish this through team building.</p> 
    <p>Being a great teammate will always be paramount in our program. Through ND baseball, our boys will become better members of all the groups that they belong to. Their most important team will always be their family, and along those lines we will strive to help them become the best teammates they can be on that important team. Now, as a son and brother (if they have siblings); later in life as a husband and father if they are so blessed. It is one of the reasons why you will often hear us shout “family” after team huddles.</p>
    <p> An underlying goal for our coaching staff is to instill their love for the great game of baseball in our student athletes. This will lead to greater enjoyment and a more gratifying experience. Baseball should be fun, win or lose, and enjoying that time on the field will always be a priority at Notre Dame. Combining that love with playing with an unmatched enthusiasm and energy, leads to greater success and meaningful memories that will last a lifetime.</p>
